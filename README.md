# speedtest-thing

My first thing I did with python. Sorry if it looks ugly or doesnt work properly.

Run speedtest.py on remote device and save results to local logfile.

This requires the following in order to work:


paramiko

easygui

speedtest.py from sivel


You will need to ammend the path to your log file.
